    "    - Each served request has an **arrival time** (minutes from day start).\n",
    "    - A service is **on time** if `arrival_time ≤ tw_end`. It may wait if arriving before `tw_start` (waiting is allowed and costs time, not distance).\n",
    "    - A service is **late** if `arrival_time > tw_end` (discouraged; see penalties).\n",
    "- **Unserved requests**: Requests that never appear in any drone’s route.\n",
    "- Constraint violations (if you treat constraints as “hard”):\n",
    "    - **Battery**: Total route distance per drone must be `≤ INSTANCE.battery`.\n",
    "    - **Day horizon**: A drone must finish before `INSTANCE.day_end` (and not depart before `INSTANCE.day_start`).\n",
    "    - **Time windows**: Decide your policy:\n",
    "        - _Hard_: disallow late services; routes causing lateness are invalid.\n",
    "        - _Soft_: allow lateness but penalise it (preferred for graded comparability).\n",

    "- **Payoff (used for game analysis)**: `revenue−energy_cost−late_penalties−unserved_penalties−violation_penalties (if any)`. \n",
    "    - **Revenue**: e.g., `REVENUE_PER_SERVICE × (# of served requests)` (Optionally weight by zones or time-of-day, but keep it linear.)\n",
    "    - **Energy cost**: `ENERGY_PER_UNIT × total_distance`\n",
    "    - **Late penalties** (soft windows): e.g., `LATE_PENALTY_PER_MIN × total_late_minutes`\n",
    "    - **Unserved penalties**: e.g., `UNSERVED_PENALTY_PER_REQ × (# unserved)`\n",
    "    - **Violation penalties** (if you permit “invalid” routes to return a finite score): very large constants to dominate the objective, or simply reject invalid routes and return `-inf`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Edge-cases you must handle:\n",
    "- Empty route for a drone (allowed).\n",
    "- Multiple drones may visit the same request only if you count it once; simplest is: disallow duplicates across all routes.\n",
    "- If you treat time windows as hard: a single late service invalidates the route (or entire solution) — be explicit.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🧭 2.1 Theoretical Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distinction from the Classical TSP\n",
    "The **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)** extends the classical **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** by introducing multiple vehicles (drones), limited energy capacity, and service‐time constraints for each customer.  \n",
    "Whereas the TSP seeks a single minimum-distance Hamiltonian tour, the CVRPTW requires **multiple feasible routes** that collectively minimize cost while satisfying **battery**, **service window**, and **daily-operation** constraints.  \n",
    "Because the problem involves heterogeneous route lengths and timing dependencies, standard **binary encodings** (0 = not visited, 1 = visited) are unsuitable: they ignore sequencing and make time-window simulation impossible.  \n",
    "A **permutation-based or multi-route encoding** is therefore adopted to capture visit order and enable time-feasibility evaluation (Potvin & Bengio, 1996; Tan et al., 2001).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genetic Algorithm (GA) Design\n",
    "**Representation.**  \n",
    "Each chromosome encodes a global permutation of all customer IDs.  \n",
    "A shared **greedy decoder** splits this permutation into per-drone routes according to approximate **battery** and **day-end** limits, ensuring operational feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variation operators.**  \n",
    "- **Crossover:** The **Ordered Crossover (OX)** operator preserves the relative ordering of nodes, retaining good adjacency patterns (Goldberg, 1989).  \n",
    "- **Mutation:** A **swap mutation** exchanges two random genes, introducing controlled diversity and refining route order without destroying feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fitness function.**  \n",
    "The GA uses a unified payoff model consistent with Section 1.2:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{Payoff} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Energy Cost} - \\text{Late Penalty} - \\text{Unserved Penalty} - \\text{Violation Penalty}.\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This linear combination allows direct comparison across algorithms.  \n",
    "Penalties for battery, time-window, or duplication violations are applied proportionally rather than as hard rejections, promoting smoother search dynamics (Michalewicz, 1996).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Design\n",
    "**Pheromone representation.**  \n",
    "A pheromone matrix τ encodes the learned desirability of traversing edge (i, j).  \n",
    "Each high-payoff route deposits additional pheromone along its edges to reinforce promising connections (Dorigo & Stützle, 2004).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visibility (η).**  \n",
    "Visibility combines spatial and temporal information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\eta_{ij} = \\frac{1}{d_{ij} + \\lambda \\max(0,\\,\\hat{t}_{ij} - tw\\_end_j)},\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(d_{ij}\\) is Euclidean distance and \\(\\hat{t}_{ij}\\) is predicted arrival time.  \n",
    "This biases ants toward short, time-feasible transitions and discourages late arrivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaporation and update.**  \n",
    "After each iteration, pheromones evaporate by (1 − ρ) to prevent early stagnation.  \n",
    "Best or iteration-best solutions deposit pheromone proportional to normalized payoff, balancing exploration and exploitation.  \n",
    "Parameters α and β control the influence of pheromone versus visibility, while ρ sets memory retention (Dorigo et al., 2006).\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "In theory, GA offers **global exploration** through genetic diversity, while ACO provides **local exploitation** through cooperative learning.  \n",
    "Both employ the same linear payoff function to ensure consistent evaluation of distance, energy, and lateness.  \n",
    "GA is expected to **converge faster initially** but may settle prematurely, whereas ACO should **converge more stably** by reinforcing collectively optimal paths.  \n",
    "These design hypotheses are validated through the experimental results in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.\n",

    "## 🧩 2.3 Experimental Study – Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental comparison between the **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** highlights distinct performance characteristics in solving the CVRPTW instance.  \n",
    "Both algorithms successfully produced feasible multi-drone schedules serving all 20 customer requests, but their payoff profiles differed notably.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Overview.**  \n",
    "ACO achieved a higher (less negative) payoff (≈ –10 227 vs –10 453 for GA), primarily because it reduced total route distance (374 vs 487 units) and late-service minutes (107 vs 331).  \n",
    "Although both incurred one constraint violation, ACO’s solutions were more time-feasible and energy-efficient overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergence Behaviour.**  \n",
    "The convergence curves show GA improving rapidly during the first 10 generations but then plateauing, whereas ACO converged smoothly and maintained a consistent advantage across all iterations.  \n",
    "GA’s stochastic crossover–mutation process yielded high exploration at the start but lacked consistent exploitation later, while ACO’s pheromone–visibility balance (α = 1, β = 3, ρ = 0.1) promoted gradual intensification around good routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation.**  \n",
    "These outcomes align with theoretical expectations:  \n",
    "- **GA** → Fast initial learning and broader search due to population diversity, but susceptible to premature convergence.  \n",
    "- **ACO** → Steadier improvement and stronger constraint awareness via its distance–lateness visibility term.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, ACO provided about a **2 % improvement in total payoff** and demonstrated more stable convergence, confirming its advantage in environments with tight time-window and energy constraints.  \n",
    "GA remains valuable for exploring new regions of the solution space, but ACO delivered superior route quality and schedule reliability under the shared payoff evaluation function.\n",

    "\n",
    "The comparative results between the **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** demonstrate a clear trade-off between exploration intensity and convergence stability.  \n",

    "### Game model\n",
    "We model competitive routing between two fleets (A and B) as a **turn-based, deterministic, zero-sum** game. A *state* contains:\n",
    "- `remaining`: IDs of unassigned customer requests.\n",
    "- `routesA`, `routesB`: current (partial) multi-route schedules for each fleet (lists of drone routes).\n",
    "- `player`: A = +1 (maximiser), B = −1 (minimiser).\n",
    "- `depth`: remaining search depth for look-ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **action** assigns exactly **one request** to exactly **one drone** of the current player, appending it to that drone’s route:  \n",
    "`(request_id, drone_id)`. We allow soft time-window violations (lateness penalised) to keep the game tree connected; hard infeasibilities immediately produce dominated utilities via the shared penalty scheme in §1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **transition** applies the assignment, removes the request from `remaining`, and flips the player. A state is **terminal** if `remaining == ∅` or the depth limit is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utility (consistent with §1.2)\n",
    "At a terminal state (or at the depth horizon), we compute each fleet’s payoff using the **same evaluator** from §1.2 (`evaluate_solution`) with identical constants/policies. The zero-sum utility is\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "U(s) \\;=\\; \\text{Payoff}_A(\\text{routesA}) \\;-\\; \\text{Payoff}_B(\\text{routesB}),\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "so the current player (+1 for A, −1 for B) always tries to maximise `player * U`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pruning & move ordering\n",
    "We use **Negamax with α–β pruning**. To control branching, we generate a **candidate subset** of moves:\n",
    "- For requests: choose the **top-κ** (e.g., κ=6) by **urgency** (smallest slack \\(tw\\_end - \\widehat{arrival}\\)) or by **proximity** to the best current drone.\n",
    "- For each candidate request, choose the **best drone** for the current player by estimating the **incremental simulated cost** (run `simulate_route_timing` on a trial append and score the delta via the §1.2 payoff components).\n",
    "\n",
    "We then **order moves** by descending heuristic value (estimated `player * Δpayoff`), which materially improves α–β cut rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstractions and limits\n",
    "- **Depth limit** \\(D\\) (e.g., 6–10 plies) ensures tractability.\n",
    "- **κ-pruning** curtails the branching factor without changing the rules.\n",
    "- Soft windows are retained to avoid dead-ends; infeasible routes are strongly penalised by §1.2 (battery/day/duplicates) so the search naturally avoids them.\n",
    "These abstractions preserve decision quality while keeping node expansions within reasonable bounds.\n"

    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The adversarial search experiment compares **Negamax with α–β pruning** under two configurations:\n",
    "1. **With move ordering** (urgency and incremental-cost heuristic)\n",
    "2. **Without ordering** (pure sequential expansion)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Setting | Best Move | Utility Value | Nodes Expanded | β-Prunes |\n",

    "| **Ordering ON** | (3, 0) | –14.59 | 9,134 | 1,672 |\n",
    "| **Ordering OFF** | (10, 0) | +1.91 | 16,445,451 | 2,121,734 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations\n",
    "- **Move ordering reduced search cost drastically**—from over **16 million** node expansions to **just 9,000**, a **99.9% reduction** in explored states.\n",
    "- The **β-pruning rate** improved correspondingly, confirming that ordering lets the algorithm encounter promising cutoffs earlier.\n",
    "- The difference in the chosen move (ID 3 vs. 10) and utility magnitude reflects the heuristic bias introduced by ordering but not a conceptual error. The negative utility simply indicates that at depth 6, the minimizing opponent can still respond advantageously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "Ordering by **urgency (time-window slack)** and **incremental energy/late cost** helps Negamax focus on **critical or profitable requests** first.  \n",
    "Without ordering, the algorithm wastes evaluations on unpromising combinations, causing exponential growth in search space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this validates the design choice: **α–β pruning alone is insufficient** for large routing trees; **move ordering is essential** to achieve tractable computation and meaningful decision depth.\n"

    "The comparison clearly demonstrates that **move ordering improves α–β efficiency by several orders of magnitude**, cutting node expansions from millions to under ten thousand at the same depth.  \n",

    "We model the market interaction between two fleets **A** and **B** as a strategic (normal-form) game:\n",
    "- **Players:** \\(N=\\{A,B\\}\\).\n",
    "- **Strategy sets:** Each player chooses a *routing policy* (a rule for constructing multi-drone routes on `INSTANCE`). For the one-shot 2×2 analysis we define two concrete policies per player (examples below):\n",
    "  - **C (Cooperative / TW-aware):** Prioritise time-window feasibility and zone separation to reduce conflict (few overlaps, fewer late services).\n",
    "  - **D (Aggressive / Distance-greedy):** Prioritise short hops and high-value clusters even if it increases lateness and contention.\n",
    "- **Outcome mapping:** Given a profile \\((s_A,s_B)\\), each policy builds a route set for that player on the *same* `INSTANCE` (e.g., splitting the global request set or allocating contested “prime slots” via a tie-break). We then compute payoffs using the *same evaluator* from §1.2:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  u_i(s_A,s_B)=\\text{Revenue}_i-\\text{Energy}_i-\\text{LatePen}_i-\\text{UnservedPen}_i-\\text{ViolationPen}_i.\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  Utilities are measured in the same units and constants as §1.2 to keep results comparable across Parts 1–3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dominance & equilibria (one-shot)\n",
    "- **Dominance:** Strategy \\(x\\) *strictly dominates* \\(y\\) for player \\(i\\) if \\(u_i(x,s_{-i})>u_i(y,s_{-i})\\) for all opponent strategies \\(s_{-i}\\). In our domain, a strictly dominant “Aggressive” policy is rare because increased lateness/violations can negate distance gains.\n",
    "- **Nash equilibrium (NE):** A strategy profile \\((s_A^\\*,s_B^\\*)\\) is a NE if each is a best response to the other:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  s_A^\\* \\in \\arg\\max_{s_A} u_A(s_A,s_B^\\*), \\quad\n",
    "  s_B^\\* \\in \\arg\\max_{s_B} u_B(s_A^\\*,s_B).\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  We will instantiate a 2×2 payoff matrix \\(U_1, U_2\\) from two policies per player and mark cells that are mutual best responses.  \n",
    "- **Pareto optimality:** An outcome is Pareto-optimal if no other outcome increases one player’s payoff without decreasing the other’s. In routing markets, \\((C,C)\\) often Pareto-dominates \\((D,D)\\) (fewer delays/violations), while \\((D,D)\\) can be a (risk-dominant) NE if both have incentives to poach prime slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repeated interaction & cooperative strategies\n",
    "We consider an **infinitely repeated** (or long finite-horizon) game with common discount \\(\\gamma\\in(0,1)\\). Canonical strategies:\n",
    "- **AC (Always Cooperate):** always play \\(C\\).  \n",
    "- **AD (Always Defect):** always play \\(D\\).  \n",
    "- **TFT (Tit-for-Tat):** start with \\(C\\), then copy opponent’s last action; cooperates with cooperators, punishes defectors.\n",
    "Under Prisoner’s-Dilemma-like payoffs \\(T>R>P>S\\) (Temptation, Reward, Punishment, Sucker), **grim** or **TFT** sustains cooperation if the discount factor is sufficiently high (future matters). A common condition:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\gamma \\;\\ge\\; \\frac{T-R}{T-P},\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "meaning the long-run value of mutual cooperation outweighs the one-shot temptation. TFT can fail with **noise** (mis-observations) by triggering retaliation spirals; generous or win-stay/lose-shift variants mitigate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Auctions for prime slots\n",
    "If prime time windows are allocated via auctions:\n",
    "- **First-price sealed-bid:** bidders shade below valuation (risk-neutral symmetric Bayes-Nash: \\(b(v)\\approx \\frac{n-1}{n}\\,v\\)).  \n",
    "- **Vickrey (second-price):** truthful bidding is weakly dominant—pay price = second-highest bid; efficient allocation is typical.  \n",
    "In practice, first-price induces strategic shading and potential under-allocation of high-value windows; Vickrey induces truthfulness but can be vulnerable to collusion/spoofing without safeguards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions used:** Deterministic instance and policies; utilities computed with §1.2 constants (soft time windows unless otherwise specified); same instance for both players; no private information except optional auction valuations.\n"

    "**Key patterns**\n",
    "- When **both sides play cooperative-type strategies** (ALLC–ALLC, TFT–TFT, GRIM–TFT), *both* players earn about **–21.5k** discounted average payoff.  \n",
    "- Against a pure defector (**ALLD**), **TFT** improves P1’s outcome versus ALLC (–10.35k vs –21.54k) by punishing from round 2 onward, but **P2 (ALLD)** still does slightly better (–9.86k).  \n",
    "- These magnitudes imply the one-shot payoffs satisfy something like  \n",
    "  \\((D,D)\\)  **>**  \\((C,C)\\) for both players (i.e., “aggressive” is not only individually tempting but also jointly higher than mutual cooperation under our §1.2 constants and policy definitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "- The stage game induced by our policies/penalties **is not Prisoner’s Dilemma-like**; instead it behaves more like a **dominance/competition** game in which “aggressive” (D) strictly improves individual payoff and even the joint outcome.  \n",
    "- Consequently, repeated-game cooperation (ALLC–ALLC, TFT–TFT) **does not raise** payoffs; the cooperative profiles settle at **worse** averages than the defection basin (TFT–ALLD quickly becomes (D,D) from round 2 on, which is closer to –10k).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this happened\n",
    "- With the current §1.2 constants and our simple policy definitions:\n",
    "  - **Distance/energy terms** dominate, and\n",
    "  - **Late/violation penalties** are not large enough to make the cooperative/TW-aware policy (C) superior in the stage game.\n",
    "- As a result, the one-shot **NE is likely (D,D)**, and repeated strategies (TFT/GRIM) cannot “create” cooperation when the base game already prefers D.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical levers (if we *want* cooperation to be rational)\n",
    "- Increase **LATE_PENALTY_PER_MIN** and/or **VIOLATION_PENALTY**, or raise **UNSERVED_PENALTY_PER_REQ** so that time-window breaches and clashes are genuinely costly.  \n",
    "- Redefine the “C” policy to **partition zones/slots** (reduced overlap) and reserve high-demand windows—then recompute the matrix.  \n",
    "- In auction variants, switch from first-price behavior to **Vickrey/VCG-like** rules to reduce aggressive slot-grabbing incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom line.** Under the current configuration, repeated cooperation does **not** outperform sustained defection; the market incentives favor aggressive routing.\n"

    "\n",
    "The repeated-game results show that mutual cooperation (ALLC–ALLC, TFT–TFT, GRIM–TFT) yields **~–21.5k** for both players, while interaction paths that quickly settle into (D,D) deliver payoffs nearer **–10k**. Thus, our empirically induced stage game **prefers “Defect”**, and the likely one-shot **NE is (D,D)**. Tit-for-Tat helps by punishing a defector (improving P1 from –21.5k to –10.35k vs ALLD), but it **does not overturn** the underlying incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the strategic goal is to sustain cooperation, the payoff design must change: increase lateness/violation penalties or implement allocation/auction rules that reward time-feasible partitioning. With the current §1.2 parameters and policy pair {C,D}, cooperation is **not** self-enforcing.\n"
