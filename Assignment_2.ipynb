    "- **Unserved requests**: Requests that never appear in any drone’s route.\n",

    "    - **Battery**: Total route distance per drone must be `≤ INSTANCE.battery`.\n",
    "    - **Day horizon**: A drone must finish before `INSTANCE.day_end` (and not depart before `INSTANCE.day_start`).\n",
    "    - **Time windows**: Decide your policy:\n",
    "        - _Hard_: disallow late services; routes causing lateness are invalid.\n",

    "    - **Energy cost**: `ENERGY_PER_UNIT × total_distance`\n",
    "    - **Late penalties** (soft windows): e.g., `LATE_PENALTY_PER_MIN × total_late_minutes`\n",
    "    - **Unserved penalties**: e.g., `UNSERVED_PENALTY_PER_REQ × (# unserved)`\n",
    "    - **Violation penalties** (if you permit “invalid” routes to return a finite score): very large constants to dominate the objective, or simply reject invalid routes and return `-inf`.\n",
